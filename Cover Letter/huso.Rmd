Dear Hiring Manager,

It is my honor and pleasure to write a letter of recommendation^[Is this the first letter that contains GIFs ever in the history of human?] for Dr. Emi Tanaka, a great hacker in my eyes.

Emi said [it was heck of a praise](https://twitter.com/statsgen/status/1023118510745038848) when I said Earo was a very impressive hacker. Well, the fact is that I have been actually impressed many more times by Emi, which is probably because Earo is a relatively low-key hacker, and I have seen a lot of cool things Emi posted on Twitter this year. If I were to write a full letter about them, it would probably take me two whole days. Below is a one-hour attempt to show the many ways in which she can be so cool.
